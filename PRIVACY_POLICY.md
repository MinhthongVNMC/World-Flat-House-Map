# Privacy Policy for WFHMAP

**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how **WFHMAP** ("we", "us", or "the Project") handles information when you use our application and services.

### 1. Information We Collect
* **Location Data:** WFHMAP may request access to your device's location to show nearby workspaces on the map. This data is processed locally on your device or sent to map service providers (like Google Maps or Mapbox) to provide the service.
* **Usage Data:** We do not track or store your personal browsing history or identity.

### 2. How We Use Information
The information processed is used solely to:
* Display your current position relative to workspaces.
* Provide directions to selected locations.
* Improve the user experience of the map interface.

### 3. Third-Party Services
Our project may use third-party services (e.g., Map APIs, Hosting providers). These services have their own privacy policies regarding how they handle location data. We encourage you to review the policies of:
* Google Maps Platform / Mapbox (as applicable)
* GitHub Pages (if hosted on GitHub)

### 4. Data Retention
**We do not store your location data on our servers.** Any location-based search or GPS positioning is temporary and is cleared once the application session ends.

### 5. Security
We implement standard security measures to protect the integrity of our source code. However, as an open-source project, users are encouraged to review the code for their own peace of mind.

### 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
